Write a program to find the adjacency list of a given directed graph G which is represented as
adjacency matrix.



Input Format:
• The first line of the input contains a positive integer n, the number of vertices in the graph,
in the range 1 to 1000.
• The next line represents the Adjacency matrix representation of the given graph.

Output Format:
• The first n lines contain the adjacency list of each node in ascending order. Each line contains
the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it sorted in ascending
order from left to right separated by a space. If a node has no adjacent nodes, then the line
corresponding to its adjacency list will contain the label of that node only.

Note: In a graph with n vertices, the vertices are labeled from 0 to n − 1.



Sample Input:
5
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0

Sample Output:
0 1 4
1 2
2
3 2
4 3
